# Stable Contracts

This document defines **contracts** that the boilerplate treats as stable. Changing them is considered a **breaking change** and should bump the **major version** (e.g. v1 → v2). Projects and integrations that depend on these can upgrade on their own schedule.

---

## 1. API response shape

All JSON responses use the same top-level structure.

**Success:**

- `success` (boolean) — always `true`
- `message` (string) — human-readable message
- `data` (object or null) — response payload; structure depends on endpoint
- `errors` (object or null) — typically `null` on success

**Error:**

- `success` (boolean) — always `false`
- `message` (string) — error message
- `data` (object or null) — typically `null`
- `errors` (object or null) — optional details (e.g. validation errors)

**Implementation:** [pkg/types/response.go](../pkg/types/response.go), [pkg/utils/response.go](../pkg/utils/response.go) (Ok, BadRequest, Unauthorized, etc.).

**Stability:** Field names (`success`, `message`, `data`, `errors`) and meaning are stable. Adding optional top-level fields in a backward-compatible way may be done in a minor release.

## 2. Authentication (protected routes)

- **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- **Token:** JWT access token from login or register (or refresh).
- **Missing/invalid:** Respond with `401 Unauthorized` and the standard error response shape above.

**Implementation:** [internal/app/middlewares/auth.go](../internal/app/middlewares/auth.go).

**Stability:** Header name and `Bearer ` prefix are stable. Changing to another scheme (e.g. API key in header) is a breaking change.

---

## 3. API path prefix

- **Versioned API:** All versioned endpoints live under `/api/v1/` (e.g. `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/profile`).
- **Unversioned:** `/health` and `/metrics` stay at root (no `/api/v1` prefix).

**Stability:** Path prefix `/api/v1` is stable. Introducing `/api/v2` is additive; removing or repurposing `/api/v1` is breaking.

---

## 4. Environment / config keys

The following env keys are part of the contract. Renaming or removing them is breaking; adding new keys is not.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `APP_ENV` | development / staging / production |
| `SECRET` | App secret (min 32 chars) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret (min 32 chars) |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug mode (e.g. Swagger) |
| `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_PORT` | HTTP server address |
| `MASTER_DB_*` (e.g. `MASTER_DB_HOST`, `MASTER_DB_NAME`, …) | Primary DB connection |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPS`, `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | Global API rate limit |

**Implementation:** [pkg/config](../pkg/config), [.env.example](../.env.example).

**Stability:** Key names and their role are stable. New optional keys may be added in minor releases.

## 5. Versioning policy

- **Semver:** Boilerplate uses semantic versioning (e.g. v1.2.0).
- **Breaking change:** Any change that violates the contracts above (or that requires callers/clients to change their code or config) → **major** version bump.
- **New features / backward-compatible changes** → **minor** version bump.
- **Bug fixes / docs** → **patch** version bump.

When a major version is released, a short **migration guide** (what changed, how to upgrade) should be provided.

---

## Why this matters

When many projects or teams use this boilerplate:

- **Stable contracts** let the core evolve (refactors, dependencies, internal structure) without forcing every consumer to change at once.
- **Clear versioning** lets consumers decide when to upgrade and what to expect (breaking vs non-breaking).
- **Documented contracts** (this file) give a single place to check “can I change this?” before doing a breaking change.
